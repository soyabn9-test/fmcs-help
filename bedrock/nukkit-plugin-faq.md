## What plugins are not allowed?

Freemcserver.net support staff get asked this a lot of times. The answer that is given is anything that goes against tos. But people don't seems to understand it so, here I am going to explain the tos and those plugins that are not allowed. The tos can be found [here](https://freemcserver.net/site/tos).

Let's start off with the most common files:

* II.2 File Uploads and Server Content - any cracked plugin or mod - cracked plugins are plugins that are downloaded for free when the official plugin is set at a price. If the plugin is not cracked and has been properly bought and you have been suspended for it then click [here](../java/java-plugin-faq.md#my-server-got-suspended-for-a-plugin-i-bought) for instructions.
* VI.12 Conduct, General Prohibitions - Run any kind of bot \(including, but not limited to, Discord or Teamspeak Bots\) - Bots are not allowed due to security reasons. So any kind of plugin like DiscordSRV or DiscordChat is not allowed.

## Banned Nukkit Plugins:

The following plugins will get your server suspended. This list does not include cracked plugins as they are against the Terms of Service already. the Terms of Service can be found [here](https://freemcserver.net/site/tos).

* DiscordChat - A plugin that enables users to see the chat, talk with them and see users that have logged in/out of their server from discord. This plugin goes against VI.12 of the Terms of Service.
* Better-MC/Discord-ChatSync - A plugin that enables users to see the chat, talk with them and see users that have logged in/out of their server from discord. This plugin goes against VI.12 of the Terms of Service.

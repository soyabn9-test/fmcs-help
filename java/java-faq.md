# Java FAQ

## Can I create a modded server?

Sure you can, but only verified users are allowed to create modded servers. Have not requested to be verified? Go to the FMCS HELP FAQ [Verification question](../#how-to-be-verified-and-do-i-need-to-complete-everything-on-the-verification-list).

Once you are verified you can head over to [Modded Server FAQ](modded-server-faq.md) to follow the steps and get started on creating the modded server.

Verification has been denied? Please go to the FMCS HELP FAQ [Verification question](../#how-to-be-verified-and-do-i-need-to-complete-everything-on-the-verification-list).

## Am I able to add a server icon to the server?

Yes, you are able to add a server icon to the server. Please upload a 64x64 png image named `server-icon.png` via FTP. Not sure which FTP and how to use it? Please follow [this](../#how-to-get-and-use-the-recommended-ftp-client) guide.

## Can I use BungeeCord with my server?

No, due to security reasons, freemcserver does not support or allow the use of BungeeCord or any other proxy systems. This is in the freemcserver.net terms of service which should have been read when using this or any other service. A link to the freemcserver.net terms of service is [here](https://freemcserver.net/site/tos).

## I am getting an Invalid Session / Invalid token / Failed to verify username error?

### Premium Account:

1. Close **ALL** minecraft related windows on your computer.
2. Then open minecraft again and try to join your server.

If this does not work try restarting your computer.

### Recent Minecraft Username Change:

1. Close **ALL** minecraft related windows on your computer.
2. Then open the launcher and log out and log back in.
3. Try to join the server.

### Cracked Account:

To resolve the error on a cracked account do the following:

1. Go to server.properties file in WebFTP
2. Find online-mode and set it to false
3. Restart your server and join.

If this does not work try to see if it is set to false in the server.properties file. If still does not work, contact support staff on [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/u99dDtE) or create a ticket. A guide to creating a ticket is [here](../#how-to-open-a-ticket).
